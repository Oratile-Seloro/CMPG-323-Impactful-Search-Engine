# CMPG-323-Impactful-Search-Engine
 Code of a solution that had the most impact on my software development career.

 
# The problem that my code solves
I made this code two years ago, at the beginning of my coding journey. During this time making sure that my database is connected at the start of the program was a huge problem, so I created a button that made sure that my database is connected to my program. The code does include two other buttons that diplays the database and the other moves the database to a listbox.

# Problem solving approach
The approach I used was the Waterfall method. I created this code a while ago and I remember using the waterfall method because it was the only method that I knew at the time.
